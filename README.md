# WATCH PARTY!!! (WIP)
Watch videos with your friends!

### Instructions
- Install the browser extension
- Find a video you want to share
- Press the host button inside the extensions menu
- Give the party id to your friends
- They enter that id into the extension
- Now enjoy the show together!
- Any time the host pauses/plays the video it will also pause/play everyone in the party

### TODO
- A LOT!! 
- Add more host controls
- Clean up UI, show/hide controls for the host and guests

### Tech I Used
- Web sockets, for a TCP connection between the browsers and the server
- The server is built in Rust, so its B_L_A_Z_I_N_G_L_Y F_A_S_T
